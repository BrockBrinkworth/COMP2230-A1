run MazeGenerator with command line argument:

javac MaveGenerator.java

java MazeGenerator

- Program will ask how many columns and rows you want then ask for a filename for "output".txt (No need to add .txt, program does it automatically).

-----------------

run MazeSolverDFS.java with command line argument:

javac MazeSolverDFS.java

java MazeSolverDFS "output.txt"

- "output" same as what you called it when running MazeGenerator. NEEDS whole "output.txt" in this case. (Doesn't add .txt automatically here)
